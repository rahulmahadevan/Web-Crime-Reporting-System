# Web-Crime-Reporting-System

The system is a client-server based web application for reporting and viewing crime based information. 

The system maintains a centralised database to store, access and display all information related to crimes to users accordingly. 

A chatbot is used to gather crime data from the user and store in the database. The chatbot gives the users a feeling of talking to an actual person and therefore helps in registering crime data efficiently. 

This crime data is used to present to users about the types of crimes happening in different places. Users can also view details of reported crimes. 

The chatbot also gives other information such as location, phone numbers of police departments, fire department, and other law enforcement agencies. The details of law enforcement are always present in the footer of every page.
